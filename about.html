        I was born in Valencia, Spain, in 1990. Since I was a little kid, I have been passionate about science, technology, and swimming!
        I was an elite swimmer for five years, hitting the top ten in the Spanish nationals several times and becoming a silver medalist in the 2012 Spanish Swimming Nationals. 
        I received an athletic scholarship to continue my mathematical studies and swimming career in the USA (Detroit city!). 
        Where I successfully manage to combine sports and studies till 2015.

        That same year I got accepted to pursue a master's degree in mathematics at the University of Miami, 
        so I got a tiny Chevy car and drove from Detroit to Miami, where I made a local friend called Geico (a wild iguana that visited me every morning).

        In 2017 I went to Switzerland, and four years later, I graduated with a Doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Bern, 
        specializing in low-dimensional topology and exploring the intricate properties of some of the most exciting mathematical knots and links.<br><br>
        Shortly after that, and given my increasing interest in Machine Learning, I continued my career in the AI field, studying data science at Zurich Constructor Learning Academy. 
        <br><br>Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (<a href="https://empa.ch/">Empa</a>), as well as a Data Science teacher at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/"><i>Le Wagon</i></a> academy, in Zurich.
        I am a member of the Astronomical Valencian Association <a href="https://astroava.org/">AVA</a> and enjoy swimming and sailing.
